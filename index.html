				<h1>Keep your CSS selectors short</h1>
				
				<p class="date">15th May, 2012 in <a href="#">Web Development</a></p>
				
				<p>One thing I believe, as a very, very general rule of thumb, is that as sites get bigger, selectors should get shorter.</p>
				
				<p>By this I mean that if you want to create extensible and maintainable, flexible and predictable websites, you should really take care to make your CSS selectors as dev-friendly as possible; i.e. short.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Increases selector efficiency</li>
					<li>Reduces location dependency</li>
					<li>Increases portability</li>
					<li>Reduces chances of selector breakage</li>
					<li>Decreases specificity</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Increases selector efficiency</h2>
				
				<p>I have written before about CSS selector efficiency. I&#8217;m going to gloss over a lot of the intricacies in this post so for a full background understanding I recommend you read <a href="#" style="">Writing efficient CSS selectors</a> first.</p>
				
				<blockquote>&#8221;This is a very vague list, so I&#8217;m going to address each in order. You will find that there is a lot of crossover between each point&#8221; &#8212; Harry Roberts</blockquote>
				
				<h3>Heading 3</h3>
				
				<p>If we ignore actual types of selector (*{} is typically the slowest, depending on how it&#8217;s being used, IDs are the fastest followed by classes, descendants are comparably quite slow followed by <a href="#">pseudo-selectors</a>) then in general it is safe to say that shorter selectors are faster.</p>
				
				<h4>H4 Heading</h4>
